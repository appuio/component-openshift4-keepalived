= Upgrade `component-openshift4-keepalived` from `v1.x` to `v2.x`

Version 2.x changes how the image used for keepalived is specified.


== Migration steps

If you use the component with the default configuration, you don't need to do anything.

If you are using an the `openshift_version` parameter, you need to change the following:

[source,yaml]
----
openshift4_keepalived:
  images:
    keepalived:
      tag: v4.18 <1>
----
<1> The tag is the version of the keepalived image to use, replacing the parameter `openshift_version`.


== Explanation of configuration changes

=== legacy `openshift_version`

The parameter `openshift_version` has been replaced by the `images.keepalived.tag` parameter.
